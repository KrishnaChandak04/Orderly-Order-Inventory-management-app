##  The Real Story Behind This App

My brother runs a **Balaji Wafers distribution business**, and I watched him struggle with the chaos of manual order management:

- **Workers taking orders on paper or WhatsApp** → Lost orders, messy handwriting
- **Manual inventory tracking** → Stock mismatches, overselling
- **End-of-day calculations by hand** → Hours of reconciliation, human errors
- **Confused billing and payments** → Customer disputes, cash flow issues

**The breaking point:** One busy day, three major orders got completely lost between the field worker's notebook and the office. That's when I knew I had to build something better.

> *"Sometimes the best software comes from watching someone you love struggle with a problem you know you can solve."*

So I built **Orderly** – a digital platform that transforms how small distributors manage their business:
- ✅ **Route-wise order entry** that's simple for workers
- ✅ **Real-time inventory sync** that prevents overselling  
- ✅ **Automated summaries and invoices** that save hours
- ✅ **Professional reports** that help grow the business

Built with ❤️ to solve a real problem at home, now available for everyone facing similar challenges.
